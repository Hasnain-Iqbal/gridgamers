This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. Grid Gamers uses additional identifiers for similar purposes, and many of our websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our use of cookies and similar technologies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Grid Gamers uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps us keep our websites up and running. In addition, we may use cookies to determine where to route your traffic to effectively distribute the Site workload across numerous servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products. We also use these technologies and allow third parties to monitor our Services and to analyze how you use our Services. For example, we may place cookies that allow us (a) to measure the time of your requests to our servers and our responses; (b) to A/B test new features; (c) to record statistics about site usage; (d) to track your activities on the Services; and (e) to track the places from which you come to the Services. We may also use third party cookies to collect information about visitor behavior on our Services for these Performance/Analytics purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Storing your preferences and settings:</strong> We use these technologies and allow third parties to use these technologies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. For example, to provide a quick link to recently-visited Tournaments in the left side navigation, we store the most recent Tournaments you’ve visited in a cookie. Saving your preferences with cookies, such as your preferred language, prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social media:</strong> Grid Gamers uses social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed in to the social media service to share content via that service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Storing information you provide to a website:</strong> We use cookies to remember information you shared. When you provide information to Grid Gamers, such as when you add products to a shopping cart on Grid Gamers websites, we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to control cookies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can manage cookies through your web browser’s option settings and through those settings you may be able (a) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies; (b) to disable cookies; or (c) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser’s help section for information on how to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our use of web beacons and other technologies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pixel tags (also known as clear GIFs or web beacons):</strong> A pixel tag is a tiny invisible tag or graphic placed on certain parts of the Services or other websites, in emails or in certain other downloadable content, but not on your computer, mobile device or browser, except to the extent that you download the content that contains such tags. Pixel tags do not store data on your computer, mobile device or browser (although they are occasionally downloaded to your computer if contained in an email or other downloadable content) so cannot be managed by you except by deleting the content in which the tag is contained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Local shared objects (also known as flash cookies):</strong> A local shared object is similar to a cookie, except it is stored on your computer or mobile device, instead of your browser, and it can store more than just text. Local shared objects are stored on your computer or mobile device.

For instance, in order to register for an event, your name and email address will be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Communication preferences:</strong> You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Grid Gamers. If you receive promotional email from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message.

You can also unsubscribe from receiving all Tournament Organizer emails sent through our system. You may still receive emails sent by Tournament Organizers through means other than our system. Tournament Organizers who have received your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that personal data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use our Services to do so. You may have to unsubscribe from multiple emails before you stop receiving communications associated with the Services. It may take up to 72 hours for us to process an unsubscribe request. Even after you opt out of all promotional communications, we will retain your personal data and non-personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you for promotional purposes. These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Grid Gamers products, programs, or activities. Note that if you unsubscribe from all emails as described above, you cannot unsubscribe from communications about updates to the Services without contacting us and closing your account.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> We currently do not participate in any “Do Not Track” frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> This Privacy Policy does not apply to any data collected by us other than personal data collected through the Services.

Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you, and the policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We recommend contacting those sites directly to confirm their privacy policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Storage and Security:</strong> We may store your data itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents, or service providers.

Any transmission of data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Services. The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

You may contact us by writing to <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"mailto:info@gridgamers.com\">info@gridgamers.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act:</strong> If you are a California resident, we process your personal data in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This CCPA section of our Privacy Statement contains information required by the CCPA and supplements our Privacy Statement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use of Personal Information:</strong> We may use, or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the purposes described above (see How We Use Personal Data).

Once we receive your request and confirm your identity, we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to an exception under the CCPA and will direct our service providers to take similar action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To exercise your rights to know or delete:</strong> Please submit a request by either:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Emailing us at <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"mailto:info@gridgamers.com\">info@gridgamers.com</a></li>\n    <li>Visiting us at <a  style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.gridgamers.com\">www.gridgamers.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.</p>\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Response Timing and Format:</strong> We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days.
