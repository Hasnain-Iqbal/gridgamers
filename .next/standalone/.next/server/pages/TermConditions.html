<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY</strong></p>



<p>Grid Platform, Inc provides software and mobile solution to improve the Services’ experience for streamers, players, tournament attendees, hosts, and spectators (collectively, “General Users”) and for registered users who are tournament organizers (“Tournament Organizers or Hosts”). Grid Gamers provides a platform for enabling connections between General Users and Tournament Organizers or Hosts and for facilitating payments through off-platform payment processors for the sale of tickets, registrations refunds, prizes and services for, and the solicitation of donations with respect to, events registered on the Site. Grid Gamers is not responsible or otherwise engaged in the processing of payments or refunds with respect to such payments. Grid Gamers also is not liable for any issues between users or damage occurred at events. These Terms of Service apply to you and your use of the Services as a Tournament Organizer or Host.</p>



<p><strong>The Services</strong></p>



<p>Grid Gamers hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services solely for the purposes of browsing the Site and using our mobile solutions, and searching for, viewing, registering for, creating, organizing, managing, running, and interacting with, an event that is registered on the Site of gridgamers.com or on our mobile solutions on both Android and iOS, in each case (i) in compliance with these Terms of Service, and (ii) to the extent permitted under all applicable laws and regulations (foreign and domestic). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not, and shall not permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (i) modify, reproduce or otherwise create derivatives of any part of the Services or Site Content (as defined below); (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of all or any part of the Services (except that this restriction shall not apply to the limited extent restrictions on reverse engineering are prohibited by applicable local law); (iii) rent, lease, resell, distribute or use the Services for timesharing, service bureau, or commercial purposes; (iv) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on or in the Services or Site Content; (v) engage in any activity that</p>



<p>interferes with or disrupts the Services; or (vi) engage in any fraudulent activity or activity that facilitates fraud.</p>



<p>If you represent to any General Users that the General User’s participation in a tournament will result in financial or any other benefit to any charitable organization or charitable cause or purpose, then you acknowledge that such representation by you may subject you to commercial co-venture or charitable solicitation laws in multiple jurisdictions within the United States or abroad. You agree that you are solely responsible for complying with all such laws and with all regulations and procedures promulgated thereunder, including but not limited to any requirements to enter into a binding agreement with each recipient charitable organization and to submit registration and reporting filings to appropriate regulatory agencies.</p>



<p><strong>NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHER PARTIES’ ACTIONS</strong></p>



<p>The Services that Grid Gamers provides are a platform for enabling connections between General Users and Tournament Organizers or Hosts, but The Company is not responsible for the performance of General Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the information they provide, nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any General User. When interacting with General Users and other Tournament Organizers, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. The Company is not responsible for the conduct or performance, whether online or offline, of any user of the Services.</p>



<p>The Tournament Organizers or Hosts may offer General Users the opportunity to participate in certain online competitions and tournaments, some of which may have prizes for the winners. If you participate in such online competitions and tournaments, you may be required to sign an Affidavit of Eligibility/Publicity and Liability Release and report as taxable income the value of any such prizes received by you. Eligibility requirements will be disclosed in connection with each online competition and tournament. To collect a prize, you may be required to provide information reasonably requested by the Tournament Organizer. Any sponsor who provides a particular prize may report the value of the prize to federal and/or state taxing authorities.</p>



<p><strong>PAYMENT</strong></p>



<p><strong>Independent Relationship of Payment Services</strong></p>



<p>Grid Gamers provides a platform by which payments can be remitted to: (i) Tournament Organizers for the sale of tickets, registrations, spectating, merchandise, and donations with respect to events registered on the Site; and (ii) General Users for refunds from such sales and donations and payment of prizes. These payments are transacted through online payment services such as Sila Money, Checkout.com, MassPay.io, or other third party payment services. Payments may also be arranged directly with Tournament Organizers or Hosts. Tournament Organizers, Hosts and General Users sending payments affect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the payment service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the payment service.</p>



<p><strong>Disputes and Refunds Other Than For Merchandise Purchases</strong></p>



<p>If you are a General User and you wish to request a refund or initiate a dispute regarding payment in connection with an event listed on the Site, you should contact the applicable Tournament Organizer or Hosts directly. It is the responsibility of a Tournament Organizer or Host to communicate its refund policy to General Users sending payments and to issue refunds as required via the payment service, or otherwise. If a General User desires to request a refund, they must request the refund from the Tournament Organizer. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Tournament Organizer and General User initiating payment and The Company will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks and refunds are between the Tournament Organizer and General User initiating payment and The Company will not be responsible or liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with a General User’s use of the Services.</p>



<p><strong>5.3 Merchandise Purchases</strong></p>



<p>The Company also provides a platform for the purchase of merchandise from the Company to help support Tournament Organizers and Hosts. All such purchases are subject to the terms of service presented at checkout. Prior to the purchase of any products or services, you must provide a valid credit card number, debit card number (or other payment account number) and associated payment information including all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card, (ii) your card number, (iii) the card type, (iv) the date of expiration, and (v) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card or payment account. By submitting that information to us or to our third party payment services, you agree that you authorize us and/or our processor to charge your card/account at our convenience. For any product or service that you order, you agree to pay the price applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time you submit the order. We will automatically bill your credit card or other form of payment submitted as part of the order process for such price. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>



<p><strong>Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes</strong></p>



<p>All payments must be made through any of the methods that are accepted at the time of payment by us or by our third party payment services providers. The Company currently does not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card or payment account, and you must refer to that agreement and not these terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a card or account holder. You will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. You represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so. YOU, AND NOT US, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. We may refuse any order that is connected with a previous credit card dispute. We may refuse</p>



<p>to accept any order if fraudulent activity is suspected and we may refuse to process any subsequent order from a customer who has a history of placing fraudulent orders.</p>



<p><strong>Cancellation and Refund Policy</strong></p>



<p>All purchase transactions for merchandise are subject to our cancellation and refund policy in effect at the time of purchase.<strong>If your order is still in “Order Received” status as reflected on your Orders &amp; Shipping page, you can reach out to Support (info@gridgamers.com) to request cancellation or a shipping address change. </strong>If your order has proceeded past this stage (pre-shipment, fulfilled, in transit), it is unable to be altered. Also, if you received votes with your purchase and the votes have been used, you cannot cancel your order after the votes have been used, regardless of the status of your order. You agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your card or payment account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your card/account has already been charged for the order); or (b) we will not charge your card/account for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.</p>



<p><strong>Return/Exchange Policy and Delivery/Shipping Policy</strong></p>



<p>All purchase transactions for merchandise are subject to our return and exchange policy and delivery/shipping policy in effect at the time of purchase. All product sales on Gridgamers.com are final and we are currently not able to process any returns or exchanges once a sale is final. If that policy changes, it will be reflected in our Return &amp; Exchange Policy. Some products or services are made-on- demand and may be subject to additional policies, conditions and restrictions, and may take longer to ship. Such on-demand items are made and fulfilled to order, and will be noted on the product or services description. Products or services made-on-demand may not be returned or exchanged unless damaged or incorrect on arrival due to our error or mistake. All products purchased from us are delivered to you by a third-party delivery company, pursuant to a shipping contract. You shall become the owner of the products and shall assume the risk of loss at the time of delivery by us of the products to the third-party delivery company. We shall not be in default if delivery is delayed or rendered impossible by forces of nature, war, civil commotion, governmental action, terrorism, fire, storm, flood, explosion, strikes, walkouts, pandemic, other industrial disturbances, utility, services or transportation interruptions or any other cause beyond our reasonable control. If your item arrived damaged or you received a size or product that you did not order, contact us as soon as you receive this order. Take a photo of the item and send the picture along with your order number and a description of your issue to our Support team and we will assess the situation and, once reviewed, issue a replacement or a refund if a replacement is not possible.</p>



<p><strong>No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products</strong></p>



<p>We do our best to describe every item, product or service offered on the Site as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that specifications or pricing on the Site is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of any item, product or service, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in our sole discretion. If we charged your credit/debit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. If we accept and process your order where a pricing or specification error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been recognized by you as a mispricing or misdescription, we may cancel the sale, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you under the order. If a product you purchased from us is not as described on the Site, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging, subject to these terms.</p>



<p><strong>Modifications to Prices or Billing Terms</strong></p>



<p>Purchases of products and services on the Site are subject to availability. All descriptions, images, references, features, content, information, specifications, products and prices described or depicted in connection with the Site are subject to change at any time without notice.

Descriptive, typographic and photographic errors are subject to correction and we shall have no liability of any kind for such errors. We reserve the right to modify or cancel orders for any reason, including for typographical, pricing and other errors at any time.

<p><strong>Arbitration<br>ONLY FOR USERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES:</strong></p>



<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED ONCE THIS SECTION IS EFFECTIVE.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Contact Us First.</strong></p>



<p>If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us first. Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.</p>



<p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong></p>



<p>In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, we each hereby agree to resolve any and all disputes or claims under these Terms of Service or with respect to the Services through binding arbitration or in small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in courts of general jurisdiction and only on an individual basis and not as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators</p>



<p>can award the same damages and relief as a court. Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review. Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section, including, without limitation, the scope, enforceability and arbitrability of these Terms of Service. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section above.</p>



<p><strong>Scope of Agreement.</strong></p>



<p>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); and (iii) all claims that may arise after termination of these Terms of Service and/or your use of the Services.</p>



<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong></p>



<p>Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies), (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission and the Texas Division of Consumer Services, which agencies may be able to seek relief on a party’s behalf , and (iii) bring suit in court to seek a preliminary injunction or other interim relief pending the outcome of arbitration. In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.</p>



<p><strong>No Class Actions.</strong></p>



<p>YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.</p>



<p><strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong></p>



<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to The Company must be addressed to the address in Section below (“Notice Address”) and must be sent by certified mail. The Notice to you must be addressed to a mailing, home or payment address currently on record with The Company and must be sent by certified mail. If The Company has no records of such physical address, such notice may be delivered to an email address The</p>



<p>Company has on file for you. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If The Company and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or The Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>



<p><strong>Arbitration Proceedings.</strong></p>



<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules, or, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Consumer Arbitration Rules (in each case, the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Section 6.10, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section. Unless The Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA shall determine the location. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>



<p><strong>Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees.</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against The Company and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then The Company will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then The Company will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse The Company for all such cost and expenses that The Company paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.</li>



<li>Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration. Should either party be determined to have</li>
</ol>



<p>substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party’s request, the arbitrator shall award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use) The Company will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>



<p><strong>Future Changes.</strong></p>



<p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and The Company agree that if The Company makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) The Company will provide you with notice of such change and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address described above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.</p>



<p><strong>Special Severability.</strong></p>



<p>In the event that the provisions of Sections above are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, the entirety of this Section shall be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim.</p>



<p><strong>Notices</strong></p>



<p>Notices to you may be sent via either email or regular mail to the address in The Company’s records. The Services may also provide notices of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices to you generally on the Services. If you wish to contact The Company or deliver any notice, you can do so as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Waiver; Invalid Provisions.</strong></p>



<p>The failure or delay of The Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No oral waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective under any circumstance whatsoever. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect.</p>



<p><strong>Judicial Forum</strong></p>



<p>In the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or for any other reason, then any dispute or claim not subject to arbitration shall be resolved exclusively by a federal court located in or within 50 miles of Plano, Texas, and to the extent there is no subject matter jurisdiction in such federal court, then a state court in or near (within 50 miles) Plano, Texas. Both you and The Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that such forum is convenient.</p>



<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>



<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>



<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service or any guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then for both you and The Company that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>



<p><strong>Assignment</strong></p>



<p>These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred, or assigned by you, but may be assigned by The Company without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of these Terms of Service shall be void.</p>



<p><strong>Survival</strong></p>



<p>Upon termination of these Terms of Service, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration.</p>



<p><strong>Headings</strong></p>



<p>The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms of Service, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions of it.</p>



<p><strong>Claims</strong></p>



<p>Any cause of action arising out of or related to the Services must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>

Products or services made-on-demand may not be returned or exchanged unless damaged or incorrect on arrival due to our error or mistake.

The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section. Unless The Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA shall determine the location. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCosts of Arbitration; Legal Fees.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003col\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003ePayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against The Company and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then The Company will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then The Company will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse The Company for all such cost and expenses that The Company paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cli\u003eJust as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration.
